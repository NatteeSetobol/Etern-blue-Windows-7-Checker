# Eternal-blue-Windows-7-Checker

Enternal Blue is a well known SMB expliot created by the NSA to attack a Windows various versions of Windows including Windows 7. Entern-Blue-Windows-7-Checker will basically send SMB packets to a host to see if that Windows host machine is vulerable to Eternal blue Exploit (CVE-2017-0143). 


Based on https://github.com/REPTILEHAUS/Eternal-Blue/blob/master/checker.py. The reason why I wrote this is, I wanted to see how the smb protocol works and how I would check for Etern-Blue exploit. I learned how to read wireshark packets and used it to create a program that checks if a Windows 7 machine is vulnerable to Eternal Blue exploit.
